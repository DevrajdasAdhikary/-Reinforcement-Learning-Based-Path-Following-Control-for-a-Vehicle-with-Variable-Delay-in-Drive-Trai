# Automatic-sanitization-machine-using-UV-C-light
In this project, we are trying to make a sanitization machine that will sanitize any product using the UV-C light and work on the user's commands. It is a mobile covid sanitization machine where the user does not have to operate it manually. UV-C Kills the germs by rupturing their cell membrane and altering their DNA/RNA. UV disinfecting chambers have already hit the market, but one of the main features that they all lacked was the 360-degree all-surface disinfection. This project overcomes those limitations and disinfects all the surfaces by flipping the items automatically after disinfecting one surface.
